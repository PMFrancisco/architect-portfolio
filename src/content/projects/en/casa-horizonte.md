## Concept

Horizonte House emerges from the need to create a family refuge that dialogues with Mallorca's Mediterranean landscape. The project explores the relationship between architecture and nature, seeking to blur the boundaries between interior and exterior.

## Process

The consultancy covered from initial feasibility studies to construction supervision, including:

- Topographic and geotechnical analysis
- Municipal permit management
- Structural engineering coordination
- Supervision of finishes and construction details

## Results

The project achieved 40% energy savings compared to similar constructions in the area, thanks to optimized orientation and implemented passive design.
